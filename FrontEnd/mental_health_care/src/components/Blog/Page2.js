                            </div>
                            <p>While there are some patterns common to grief among all people, everyone is unique. Your path through grief
                                is yours alone, and it may take more or less time than you expected to start to feel better. Be patient and
                                allow yourself to handle all the emotions associated with the loss.

                                Feelings of grief are terrible. At times it can be unbearable, but recognize that this is part of the
                                healing process. Rather than trying to escape these bad feelings, move through them so that you come out the
                                other side in better mental health.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>Family traditions and rituals are sacred events. Whether family reunions, religious gatherings, the
                                holidays or family-famous treats, they are all important. These traditions aren’t something you do every day
                                or that are programmed in your mind as an automatic reaction. You choose to do them because they were
                                created with love and meaning to bind your family together. It is the sentiment behind them that make
                                traditions so important.</p>
                            <p>

                                So what happens when you lose an integral part of that tradition? After losing a loved one you may need to
                                modify or skip those traditions completely. It is evident when the tradition comes around that things are
                                not going to be the same. You may be tempted to try to keep things exactly as they were before to maintain
                                the sense of safety and security you felt before losing your loved one. You may feel like if you change or
                                skip the tradition, you are just as much abandoning that time in your life when your loved one was still
                                alive. Either reaction is fine – the most important thing to do is acknowledge things are going to be
                                different.

                                Here are just a few suggestions on how to remain positive, keep those traditions alive or start new
                                traditions: </p>

                            <p>Not only can you change traditions, but you are also allowed to choose your activities and interactions
                                with others. Don’t be afraid to decline invitations to parties or events. If you can’t be around certain
                                people right now, don’t.

                                Avoid letting other people’s expectations, pressure, or potential disappointment dictate your boundaries.
                                Set them yourself based on your needs and well-being during this difficult time. Those who care about you
                                will understand and won’t take it personally. </p>

                            </div>


                            <p>The holiday is a time of gathering with friends and family. It’s a joyous season marked by laughter, good
                                spirits and time-honored traditions. But for those missing a spouse, parent, child or loved one, the holiday
                                season can be challenging.
                                Whether the loss is recent or several years old, this time of year is a stark reminder of the people who are
                                missing from the dinner table or whose stocking won’t be filled on Christmas morning.
                                Grieving the loss of a loved one at the holidays – especially the first holiday – is a completely natural
                                process. One way to make the loss just a little easier is by creating new traditions that honor a loved
                                one’s memory.</p>
                            <p>
                                Create an ornament with the loved one’s name or photo that you can hang on the Christmas tree. Pulling that
                                ornament out of the box each year is a great time to share a cherished memory from a past holiday. And it’s
                                especially important for children or grandchildren who may not have many memories of that particular family
                                member.</p>
                            <p>
                                As you gather for a holiday dinner or Christmas Eve gift exchange, take some time to remember lost loved
                                ones with a special story, funny anecdote or holiday memory. This tradition encourages family members to
                                focus on those special times together rather than the heavy grief of the loss.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>A good place to start is to look at mood/emotional wellness/mental health through the lens of our core
                                values, since
                                these influence the products we build. So here they are along with some extra narrative.
                                - We believe that literally everyone needs some emotional help from time to time and that we're not that
                                different from
                                one another.
                                Life gives us all ups and downs. Very few people are so blessed with great parenting, great brain chemistry,
                                and no significant
                                negative events in their lives. The remaining 99.9% of us need some help now and then.
                                - We believe there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution to mood and that trying different tools and
                                documenting their results
                                is critical to understand what works for you.
                                There are many tools and treatments to help people with the health of their moods including psychotherapies
                                like CBT and
                                numerous anti-depressants (too many to list), as well as lifestyle factors like sleep hygiene, exercise,
                                sunlight exposure and more. We all respond differently both in terms of how these treatments effect their
                                mood and the potential side effects. It's all about a willingness to try different tools,
                                not giving up if the first one doesn't work (as is often the case), and documenting your results. </p>
