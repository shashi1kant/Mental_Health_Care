              </div>
              <p className="page3titlep">Borderline personality disorder is a mental health condition and personality disorder. Like other
                personality disorders, BPD affects how you see the world, how you view yourself, how you relate to others,
                and how you behave and react. BPD specifically causes:
                Difficulty creating a self-identity, even feeling empty inside or as if you don’t exist
                Intense fear of being abandoned by loved ones
                Difficulty creating a self-identity, even feeling empty inside or as if you don’t exist
                Intense fear of being abandoned by loved ones
                Threats of suicide or self-harm
                A residential mental health facility is ideal for someone with both conditions. The response to treatment
                takes time in complicated cases like these. Staying in a residence for a several weeks or a few months
                allows you to focus on treatment and learning to manage your symptoms

                <h2 className="page3h2">How to Cope and Live Well With Both BPD and Depression</h2>

              </div>
              <p className="page3titlep">The prognosis for a diagnosis of both depression and BPD is worse than either condition alone. It can feel
                hopeless facing this dual diagnosis, but there is hope. With good treatment and support from caring loved
                ones, it’s possible to enjoy life and to have good relationships.



                The most important thing you can do to manage BPD and depression is get treatment. Treating these two
                conditions is challenging and requires addressing both at the same time. Good treatment should also consider
                the way the conditions interact and affect each other.
                Choose a treatment center experienced with co-occurring conditions. It is essential that your treatment
                plan is tailored to your unique needs. BPD with depression will not respond the same way to treatment
                designed for just one or the other. And BPD is not likely to improve if you only address and treat the
                depression.
                <h3 className="page3h2">Bring Your Emotions Under Control.</h3>
                One of the characteristics of BPD that makes it so disruptive is the emotional whirlwind you experience on
                a daily basis. Take steps to manage your intense feelings and you’ll be better able to cope, relate to other
                people, and avoid slipping into a depression.

                Strong emotions are a reality of BPD, so don’t deny them. Recognize those feelings and accept them. Being
                mindful, staying in touch with the present moment, will help you live with the big emotions that feel as if
                they will take over.</p>

              </div>
              <p className="page3titlep">Impulsivity is a common characteristic of BPD. You may engage in risky behaviors or lash out at people with
                little forethought. Impulsive behaviors that you later regret can also trigger depressive episodes. If you
                can learn to control impulses, you’ll feel better.

                Many people with BPD act impulsively because they feel overwhelmed by difficult emotions. To get relief, you
                may do something you know you shouldn’t. To manage these impulses, you need to learn how to deal with and
                tolerate the bad feelings.

                When emotions build to an intolerable level, pause and assess them. Name your feelings and accept them. It
                also helps to ground yourself in the moment. Focus on your senses and breathing to calm down. If these
                strategies fail, try a distraction: Watch TV, call someone, do chores around the house, or anything else
                that will take your attention away from the emotions you’re feeling. </p>

                <h2 className="page3h2">Plan for a Crisis.</h2>

              </div>


              <p className="page3titlep">When you’re in the middle of a storm of emotions, you may struggle to do what you know will help or to tell
                others what you need. Make a plan with loved ones for how to deal with this situation, so they know what to
                do.

                The plan should include a mental health first-aid kit with strategies, coping mechanisms, and objects that
                calm you and help you bring your feelings back under control. It could include a list of your proven stress
                busters like a scented candle you like, a favorite book, or sayings that you take comfort in. Whatever
                triggers calm for you will be ready and waiting if you experience a crisis.

                Coping with this difficult dual diagnosis isn’t easy. Living with BPD or depression alone is hard enough,
                but the two interact and trigger and worsen symptoms. You can live well with complicated mental health
                issues, but it takes work. Keep up with treatment, even after a residential stay. Use coping mechanisms and
                the support of loved ones to live your best life.</p>

                <h3>A Look at Mood & Mental Health: Our Core Values</h3>

              </div>
              <p className="page3titlep">A good place to start is to look at mood/emotional wellness/mental health through the lens of our core
                values, since
                these influence the products we build. So here they are along with some extra narrative.
                - We believe that literally everyone needs some emotional help from time to time and that we're not that
                different from
                one another.
                Life gives us all ups and downs. Very few people are so blessed with great parenting, great brain chemistry,
                and no significant
                negative events in their lives. The remaining 99.9% of us need some help now and then.
                - We believe there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution to mood and that trying different tools and
                documenting their results
                is critical to understand what works for you.
                There are many tools and treatments to help people with the health of their moods including psychotherapies
                like CBT and
                numerous anti-depressants (too many to list), as well as lifestyle factors like sleep hygiene, exercise,
                sunlight exposure and more. We all respond differently both in terms of how these treatments effect their
                mood and the potential side effects. It's all about a willingness to try different tools,
                not giving up if the first one doesn't work (as is often the case), and documenting your results. </p>
