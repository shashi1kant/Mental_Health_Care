                            </div>
                            <p>The dreaded fear of missing out, or FOMO, rears its ugly head all the time on social media. When scrolling
                                through other people’s posts, you can quickly get the sense that you’ve missed out on activities, inside
                                jokes, or new friendships.

                                This feeling is particularly hurtful if you see friends or family online doing things without you. Realizing
                                that you’ve been left out of a party or other event feels awful and can leave you feeling depressed, sad and
                                lonely.

                                Seeing all the great things other people have in their lives can also give you a powerful sense of
                                inadequacy. You’re not just missing out on events or parties. You may also feel like you’re missing out on a
                                better life. </p>

                            </div>
                            <p>Comparison with others can be positive and motivating, but it can also be bad for your mental health. Keep
                                in mind that people often only post the good things in their lives. Many only give the highlights, which
                                paints a false picture of a perfect life.

                                That friend with what seems like the perfect career that you never achieved isn’t showing you all the
                                downsides. She’s not posting about the 80-hour workweeks or the fact that she doesn’t have time to start a
                                family or maintain a healthy relationship.

                                Social media posts can also give you a skewed view of beauty and appearance. Influencers often have pro
                                photographers and makeup, great lighting, and the right pose to get shots just right. They also use filters
                                to remove imperfections. Even if you know this is the case, after seeing so many pictures of perfection,
                                it’s easy to experience low self-esteem. </p>

                            </div>
                            <p>The name social media indicates a coming together of friends, family and acquaintances. It certainly can be
                                a tool for that, but too often, it leaves people more isolated than they would be otherwise.

                                Multiple studies indicate that social media use correlates with greater social isolation. In one study,
                                researchers monitored 143 college students. One group used social media normally, while the other was
                                limited to 30 minutes per day for several weeks. Those who limited their use experienced less depression and
                                loneliness.

                                Another study involved over 1,000 adults and found similar results. Those that reported more than two hours
                                a day of social media use felt more socially isolated than people who scrolled for 30 minutes or less.

                                There is a definite correlation, but the cause isn’t 100 percent clear. It could be that lonely people are
                                more likely to turn to social media sites. It may also be that social media use limits the time people spend
                                in face-to-face interactions. Real-world social interactions are good for overall wellness and can’t be
                                replaced by online connections. </p>

                            </div>
                            <p>Many studies have found that social media use increases feelings of anxiety and depression. Much of this
                                results from comparison. Social comparison online can lead you to ruminate on what you’re missing and what
                                could be better in your life. Rumination is a core characteristic of depression.

                                These studies show that the time spent on social media is important to note. The more time people spend
                                online using social media sites, the more likely they are to have depression symptoms. There is also a
                                correlation between time online and anxiety.

                                Another reason that social media use may trigger anxiety and depression is the isolation factor. Humans are
                                social animals, and if social media replaces a lot of your face-to-face interactions, it can impact your
                                mental health. </p>

                            </div>
                            <p>This is especially a risk for young people, but anyone on social media can fall victim to bullying trolls.
                                People say things online they wouldn’t to your face. Trolls seem to take delight in going online to make
                                other people miserable.

                                According to a study from the Pew Research Center, 59% of teens have been bullied online. Some of the
                                behaviors they reported include:

                                Name-calling
                                Fake rumors
                                Explicit images, both received and shared without consent
                                Stalking
                                Physical threats</p>
                            <p>Bullied children and teens are more likely than their peers to develop depression and anxiety and to have
                                low self-esteem. Event witnesses to bullying experience negative mental health consequences, including
                                anxiety, depression, and stress.

                                Adult bullying online also happens, and the victims can struggle with the same issues as young people. You
                                may have more coping mechanisms as an adult, but the hurt is just as strong</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>Social media isn’t inherently bad for you. It becomes a problem when you can’t stop. Social media sites are
                                designed to trigger addictive tendencies. The visual and sound stimuli, like the thumbs up on a post or the
                                ding of a notification, trigger the pathway in the brain associated with pleasure and reward.

                                The pleasure you experience from getting a “like” or “comment” triggers dopamine release in the brain.
                                Dopamine is a feel-good brain chemical. It has an evolutionary benefit, encouraging you to engage in
                                positive activities like exercise and social interaction.

                                Drugs hijack this pathway, but social media can do it too. Over time, you find you want the pleasure of a
                                post recognition more frequently. In between, when you’re off the phone or not getting any likes, you begin
                                to crave it.

                                This is a simplified explanation of addiction. You don’t have to become addicted to social media. And, you
                                don’t have to be addicted to experience many of its negative mental health consequences.

                                The more you let yourself get hooked, the more likely it is that online activities will harm your mental
                                health. Armed with this information, you can make positive changes to limit social media use and protect
                                your mental health.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>Social media isn’t all bad. It can’t be used as an excuse for all mental health woes. When used the right
                                way, social media platforms can be neutral or even beneficial. For instance, it provides a chance to connect
                                with others.

                                If your family lives far away, for instance, you can easily stay in touch on these platforms, helping you
                                feel more connected. If you have a mental illness that makes normal social interactions difficult, online
                                communities provide an outlet.

                                Social media can also connect you to peer support groups for mental illness, grief, and more. You can access
                                information online more efficiently than ever. You may even be able to connect with your mental health care
                                providers, facilitating better engagement with your treatment.

                                Social media can be a useful tool in moderation. Be aware of the pitfalls and risks. By understanding how it
                                can be harmful, you can make better choices about using social media. And if you try to limit your use and
                                find you can’t, reach out to mental health professionals who can help you set and achieve positive goals.

                            </div>
                            <p>A good place to start is to look at mood/emotional wellness/mental health through the lens of our core
                                values, since
                                these influence the products we build. So here they are along with some extra narrative.
                                - We believe that literally everyone needs some emotional help from time to time and that we're not that
                                different from
                                one another.
                                Life gives us all ups and downs. Very few people are so blessed with great parenting, great brain chemistry,
                                and no significant
                                negative events in their lives. The remaining 99.9% of us need some help now and then.
                                - We believe there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution to mood and that trying different tools and
                                documenting their results
                                is critical to understand what works for you.
                                There are many tools and treatments to help people with the health of their moods including psychotherapies
                                like CBT and
                                numerous anti-depressants (too many to list), as well as lifestyle factors like sleep hygiene, exercise,
                                sunlight exposure and more. We all respond differently both in terms of how these treatments effect their
                                mood and the potential side effects. It's all about a willingness to try different tools,
                                not giving up if the first one doesn't work (as is often the case), and documenting your results. </p>
